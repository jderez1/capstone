        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I developed a software that companies can integrate into their webshop via a subscription. The software is a selection aid/ product recommendation quiz to make it easy for their customers to find the right products. This results in more turnover, longer sessions and higher customer satisfaction. I want to make a difference with advanced technology and personal support. The mission is to support and encourage B2C companies in their online sales efforts through innovative guided sales software and personal guidance. Iâ€™m committed to reducing customer overwhelm, increasing conversion rates, and providing valuable insights. The mission is to help companies grow and excel in an increasingly digital world, all with a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction and lasting partnerships.</p>
